    Consider these immutable once constructed. As a side effect of a
    memory-saving strategy in the cache, multiple references to a single
    ``Node`` might be returned in a single parse tree. So, if you start
    messing with one, you'll see surprising parallel changes pop up elsewhere.

    My philosophy is that parse trees (and their nodes) should be
    representation-agnostic. That is, they shouldn't get all mixed up with what
    the final rendered form of a wiki page (or the intermediate representation
    of a programming language, or whatever) is going to be: you should be able
    to parse once and render several representations from the tree, one after
    another.
